          <h5>February 2016</h5>
          <p>I'm the kind of person who goes to a party and will talk to all the animals there before the people. You could say I'm kinda crazy about them - especially if they ruff. What I find discouraging is that frequently websites and programs advocating for animal welfare have left design somewhere in the dust. I think a huge part of this is their priority to have a majority of donations go straight to the animals who need it - which I love. Maybe more designers should be doing some probono work for their favorite non-profits!</p>
          <p>Anyways, part of learning to create and design is just doing something, anything, to get your feet wet. For this project I didn't have a long term goal other than to make something I thought looked pretty snazzy for an organiztion I respected. So, I decided to tackle the partial redesign of the Humane Society website. While I firmly believe in The Humane Society's cause, I felt their website distracted more than it added to the conversation.</p>

          <h3 id="stage1">Stage 1 - Sifting out the important bits</h3>
          <p>Part of the reason I was drawn to this project was my own efforts to navigate the Humane Society website. I was so overwhelmed with links, photos, and pop-ups it didn't make for a very pleasing experience on my first visit. It is immediately clear that receiving <strong>donations</strong> is the primary purpose of the website - I counted three separate places to find out more about donating just above the fold on the landing page, and that doesn't include a pop-up that appears mere seconds after landing on the page.
          <p>While it is important for visitors to find donation information, they shouldn't be bombarded with this information if they are just wanting to visit the site. This site is rich in content all competing for space. Rather than finding this helpful, as a user it seemed like overkill to have a link to so many pages throughout the website.</p>
          <p>Another drawback was that often webpages didn't seem to fit into the same aesthetic as others. It was like they had been designed at different times or by different people and never updated to match. I wanted to give the website a cleaner more cohesive feel that enhanced user experience and kept them coming back for more.</p>
          <p>One of my close friends is a passionate and involved animal advocate so I asked her about her experience on the website. She said she had visited it once to make a recurring donation and never revisted, and found the constant pop-ups distracting.</p>
          <blockquote>
            This hit the website's issue right on the head to me. Humanesociety.org has a lot of rich content and my friend - their ideal target audience - has only used the website ONCE!
          </blockquote>

          <p>With this redesign I sought to target some of the main issues I experienced with the website in order to improve user experience. They included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A clearly communicated message about donations that didn't overwhelm the user</li>
            <li>A logo with a more iconic feel that fits well on small screens</li>
            <li>Highlighted sections that viewers may be interested in, including important current news</li>
            <li>Prime real estate for finding an animal to adopt</li>
            <li>Well organized news section - I feel like this should be a major focus for this website for bring users back to the page who care about the latest in animal welfare</li>
            <li>A redesigned interface that allows users to sign up for alerts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I wanted to give these sections a design lift, cleaning up the Humane Society's message into a layout that was not overwhelming and largely photo driven.</p>

          <small>The original Humane Society landing page on the <strong>left</strong>. You can see the four different places to click to find out more about donating in this screenshot. The original news home page on the <strong>right</strong> I found these two pages to be among the most consitent design-wise.</small><br><br>

          <small>The original Humane Society alert page on the <strong>left</strong>, and the original donations page on the <strong>right</strong>. This is where I noticed some of the design consistency breaking down. You can notice the familiar side nav is not gone making it difficult for users to navigate back and forth between pages.</small><br><br>


          <h3 id="stage2">Stage 2 - Coming up with a new palette</h3>
          <p>I like to start with a logo and color palette on projects where I am building from the ground up. I felt that the Humane Society's current logo clearly communicates a love of animals, but is otherwise busy and not web-friendly for use on different devices. I find that most people know what the Humane Society does so I felt a cleaner, simpler logo would suit their needs just as well. A more minimal logo also allows for easy resizing on smaller devices and horizontal and vertical orientations.</p>
          <p>I wanted the color palette to be slightly more muted than the current one, really letting the photos of animals shine through. Rather than a primary (red, yellow and blue) color scheme, I opted for dark blues and greys with a pop of color.</p>
